# SpecForge Project Overview

## What SpecForge Is

SpecForge is a project planning and memory workspace for AI-assisted software builders. It helps users move from raw ideas to PRDs, architecture docs, context files, shippable feature specs, coding-agent prompts, build tracking, issue prompts, knowledge insights, and exportable markdown packs.

## Who It's For

SpecForge is for solo developers and small-team builders using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or similar AI coding tools who lose project context across multiple chats, notes, prompts, and half-finished planning documents.

## Core User Journey

1. User signs up.
2. User signs in with email/password or Google OAuth.
3. User lands on the dashboard.
4. User creates a new private project.
5. User enters a rough project idea.
6. SpecForge asks clarifying questions.
7. User answers the questions and tightens the idea.
8. SpecForge generates a project brief.
9. User reviews and edits the project brief.
10. SpecForge generates a PRD.
11. User reviews and edits the PRD.
12. SpecForge generates an architecture document.
13. User reviews and edits the architecture.
14. SpecForge generates project context files.
15. SpecForge breaks the work into shippable chunks.
16. User reviews chunks on the chunk board.
17. SpecForge generates a feature spec for the selected chunk.
18. SpecForge generates a Claude Code/Cursor/Codex-ready agent prompt.
19. User tracks progress, converts issues into corrective specs, and captures lessons from notes or transcripts.
20. User exports project pack and starts coding in Claude Code/Cursor.

## MVP Scope

- [ ] Auth - sign up, sign in, sign out, and protected app access.
- [ ] Dashboard - project list and entry point into the workspace.
- [ ] Project creation - create private projects from raw ideas.
- [ ] Idea clarifier - collect answers that improve generated planning docs.
- [ ] PRD generator/editor - generate, edit, and preserve product requirements.
- [ ] Architecture generator/editor - generate, edit, and preserve technical architecture.
- [ ] Context files generator - produce context files that coding agents can read.
- [ ] Shippable chunk generator - break projects into sequential build chunks.
- [ ] Chunk board - track chunks across build states.
- [ ] Feature spec generator - turn a chunk into an implementation-ready spec.
- [ ] Agent prompt generator - produce Claude Code/Cursor/Codex-ready prompts.
- [ ] Progress tracker - keep the project build state current.
- [ ] Issue-to-spec converter - turn bugs and review feedback into corrective specs.
- [ ] Knowledge/transcript ingestion - extract reusable engineering lessons from notes.
- [ ] Markdown/ZIP export - export project packs that travel outside the app.
- [ ] Usage logging - record generation and usage metadata for product limits.
- [ ] Basic rate limits - protect AI and backend endpoints from abuse.
- [ ] Vercel deployment - deploy the SPA when production deployment is configured.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

Do not build unless explicitly requested:

- Team collaboration
- Payments
- GitHub integration
- Cursor extension
- Browser extension
- Real-time multiplayer
- Template marketplace
- Admin dashboard
- Enterprise roles
- Full RAG system
- Direct AI code execution inside the app

## Tech Stack at a Glance

See `context/02-architecture.md` for the canonical architecture. Short version:

- Repo: single repository with `frontend/` and `backend/`.
- Frontend: Vite, React, TypeScript strict mode, React Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
- Backend: Supabase Postgres, Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage, Supabase Edge Functions on Deno.
- Database authorization: Postgres Row Level Security on every user-data table.
- Auth: Supabase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth.
- AI: OpenAI and Anthropic behind `backend/_shared/ai/generate(...)`.
- Validation: Zod, with shared schemas in `backend/_shared/schemas/`.
- Deployment: SPA to Vercel or Netlify, Edge Functions and migrations to Supabase.

## Key Differentiators

- Continuity across the full lifecycle: idea -> PRD -> architecture -> context -> chunks -> specs -> prompts -> tracker -> issues -> export.
- Tool-agnostic outputs for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or a generic coding-agent workflow.
- Built-in issue-to-spec converter and knowledge-to-rules ingestion.
- Exportable markdown packs so the project can travel outside the app.
- Project memory is treated as the core product, not as a side effect of chat history.
